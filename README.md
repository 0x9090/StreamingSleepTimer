# Streaming Sleep Timer
Closes Chrome &amp; Turns Off Monitors After An Interval

I like falling asleep to streaming media (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, DirecTV Now, etc.) but hated getting out of bed to shut everything off. This program is a simple re-creation of the standard Sleep Timer feature on many TV's. When first run, a window will prompt for the number of mintues to sleep. After that time expires, it will close all Chrome windows and turn off all monitors.

Class used to shut off the monitors was taken from: http://www.vilipetek.com/2014/06/18/turn-off-monitor-power-in-windows-using-ddcci-c/
